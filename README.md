  }
}
```

Example for getting all posts:

      "_id": "6164884b7b4bdf0578f75a8d",
      "title": "first post",
      "text": "first posts text"
    },
    {
      "_id": "6164bc53511d7d0fac32d883",

}
```

    Title     string
    Text      string
    CreatedAt *time.Time
    UpdatedAt *time.Time

## Todo

### Building

- Add database volume to make it persistent. (Fix readme accordingly)

### Backend

- Payload validation and errors accordingly.
- Enable paging for getAllPosts (the database is bound to get bigger normally)

### Frontend

- The frontend is kinda missing. So needs to be implemented at some point. Will be created in the folder "frontend".
